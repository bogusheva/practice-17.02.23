      <h2>Hello, friends!</h2>
      <p>
        Before you buy a dog or cat, just come round to our shelter. It hosts
        many faithful friends. You will find the one to love and take care of.
        They are different: big, small, ready to protect you anytime, friendly,
        lazybones, and restless. Whenever you adopt a pet, you save the three: a
        pet you give home, another homeless pet that will find a vacant place in
        the shelter, and a Human in your heart. Adopt, donâ€™t shop, cause the
        true friendship is priceless!
      </p>
